# Python_IrisDataAnalysisAndMachineLearning

The iris flowers dataset.The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.I have used done preprocessing steps on the dataset which included filling missing values,dividing the dataset into train and test dataset.
Then different models were made using Python to predict the SpeciesType of the flower and each model's accuracy were compared.
